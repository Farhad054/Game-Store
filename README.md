# Project overview:
The goal of this project is to create an easy-to-use web store for an independent game shop. The web store will provide the owner and the employees with all the functionalities required to manage their product catalog, inventory, and customer orders. 
Furthermore, it will provide a seamless experience for customers looking to buy or return a game.
